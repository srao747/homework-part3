I launched Eclipse on my computer and proceeded to generate a DTD file and an XML file. Both files contained the JRE System library and src, and were used to create additional files and write code.i made an XML file and an XSD file using extensions .xml and .xsd. i created a parser source code file called DomParserSchema for executing the schema of the xml file with the necessary data and  changed file and tag names as required, and uploaded the code to github when it produced the expected output.
